<h1>Math.NET Classic</h1>
<p>
Math.NET Classic is an opensource framework written in C# for symbolic mathematical operations in an object-oriented way,
supporting scalar & complex Linear Algebra (Vector, Matrix, Tensor), Complex Expressions,
Hyperbolics and Trigonometry, Logic Algebra, 3D geometry with vectors and plains, digital circuits and
finite state machines as well as operations like derivation, integration, taylor approximation,
expression evaluation, irregular linear system solving and more.

<h2>Contribute</h2>
<p>
If you have <a href="http://windows.github.com/">Github for Windows</a> installed you can click <a href="github-windows://openRepo/https://github.com/mathnet/mathnet-classic">here</a>
to fetch the sources, otherwise clone it in the shell with:</p>
<pre>$ git clone git://github.com/mathnet/mathnet-linqalgebra.git</pre>

<p>
We use the <em><a href="https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/">Fork & Pull model</a></em>, as common for GitHub projects.
Instead of asking for permission, simply fork the project on GitHub, commit your changes in a separate branch and send a pull request to one of the maintainers.
A maintainer will then merge your changes back to mainline, or work together with you on the changes if they are not acceptable yet.
Only maintainers can write to mainline, but anyone can contribute - don't ask, do!
</p>
<p>
Of course other contributions are very welcome as well, being it some publicity, more interesting code samples, code reviews, extending the documentation or even just some ideas.
We're also looking for maintainers.
